# 0007-Sprint-Plan-Plugin-Schema-Decoupling

**Date:** 2025-09-07
**Status:** ï¿½ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** High  
**Related:** [ADR-006-decouple-plugin-manifests-from-target-structure.md], [ADR-005-git-hook-execution-ordering-strategy.md]
**Branch:** feature/plugin-schema-decoupling

---

## Executive Summary

This sprint implements ADR-006: Decouple Plugin Manifests from Target Structure Schema. The goal is to eliminate tight coupling between plugin manifests and the global target structure schema by introducing plugin-specific structure schemas and a schema composition system. This will enable true plugin independence and eliminate the coordination nightmare for plugin developers.

**Current Status: 75% Complete** - Sprint started on feature/plugin-schema-decoupling branch. Phase 1 COMPLETE (4/4 tasks). Phase 2 SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE (3/4 tasks). Phase 3 Task 3.1 Interactive Conflict Resolution COMPLETE.

---

## Sprint Goal

Transform plugin architecture from tightly-coupled global schema dependency to autonomous plugin structure composition with clear separation of concerns.

**Duration:** 8 weeks (4 phases as defined in ADR-006 migration plan)

---

## Architecture Transformation

### Current State (Problematic)
```yaml
# Plugin Manifest contains target structure knowledge
configuration:
  target_structure_extensions:
    ".ai/guardrails/":
      files:
        "acl.yml":
          required: false
          description: "ACL policy configuration"
```

### Target State (Decoupled)
```yaml
# Plugin Structure Schema (independent)
# src/plugins/guardrails-acl-kit/plugin-structure.schema.yaml
provides_structure:
  ".ai/guardrails/":
    files:
      "acl.yml":
        required: false
        description: "Access control list policy configuration"
        schema_ref: "acl.schema.json"

# Plugin Manifest (installation-focused)
# plugin-manifest.yaml
components:
  acl-policy:
    description: "ACL policy configuration"
    source_patterns:
      - ".ai/guardrails/acl.yml"
```
