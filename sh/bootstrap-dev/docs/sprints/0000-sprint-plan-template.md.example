---

## Risks & Mitigation

### ðŸš¨ Configuration Complexity

**Risk:** Unified configuration system might be complex to maintain
**Mitigation:**

- Use well-established libraries (Pydantic) with good validation
- Provide clear documentation and examples
- Implement configuration testing

### ðŸš¨ Security Gaps

**Risk:** Security implementation might miss important vulnerabilities
**Mitigation:**

- Follow established security best practices
- Implement security scanning in CI/CD
- Regular security reviews

### ðŸš¨ Documentation Maintenance

**Risk:** Operational documentation might become outdated
**Mitigation:**

- Keep documentation close to code
- Implement documentation testing where possible
- Regular documentation review cycles

class AppConfig(BaseSettings):
    debug: bool = Field(False, env="DEBUG")
    log_level: str = Field("INFO", env="LOG_LEVEL")
    database: DatabaseConfig = DatabaseConfig()
    llm: LLMConfig = LLMConfig()

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        env_file_encoding = "utf-8"
        case_sensitive = False
```

## Operational Runbooks

### Build Recovery Runbook

```markdown
# Build Recovery Procedures

## Stuck Build Recovery
1. Identify stuck build: `SELECT * FROM builds WHERE stage != 'DONE' AND stage != 'FAILED' AND updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'`
2. Check logs: `grep build_id=<BUILD_ID> /var/log/ai_deck_gen.log`
3. Resume build: `make resume-build BUILD_ID=<BUILD_ID>`
4. If resume fails, mark as failed: `UPDATE builds SET stage='FAILED', error='Manual intervention' WHERE id='<BUILD_ID>'`

## Circuit Breaker Recovery
1. Check breaker status: `curl /healthz | jq .dependencies`
2. Wait for automatic recovery (30s default)
3. Manual reset: `curl -X POST /admin/circuit-breakers/reset`
4. Monitor recovery: `tail -f /var/log/ai_deck_gen.log | grep circuit_breaker`
```
