## Configuration Schema

```python
# domain/model.py - Core data structures
from dataclasses import dataclass
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Literal, Sequence

ActionKind = Literal["COPY", "MERGE", "TEMPLATE", "SKIP"]
Reason = Literal["new", "hash-diff", "unchanged", "drift"]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class FileAction:
    kind: ActionKind
    src: Path
    dst: Path
    mode: int | None
    reason: Reason

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ComponentPlan:
    name: str
    actions: Sequence[FileAction]
    manifest_digest: str
    plugin_id: str | None

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class InstallPlan:
    components: Sequence[ComponentPlan]
    total_files: int
    estimated_size: int
```

---

## CLI Usage Examples

```bash
# Preview installation plan
ai-guardrails plan --profile full

# Dry run without changes
ai-guardrails install --profile full --dry-run

# Install with verbose logging
ai-guardrails install --profile standard --verbose

# Validate current installation
ai-guardrails doctor

# Repair detected issues
ai-guardrails doctor --repair

# List available components
ai-guardrails list --components
```

---

## Architecture Validation

### Pure/Effectful Separation
- **Pure**: `resolver.py`, `planner.py` - No side effects, deterministic
- **Effectful**: `installer.py`, `doctor.py` - Only components that modify filesystem
- **Single Funnel**: All content transformations through `yaml_ops.py`

### Transaction Safety
- **Per Component**: Each component uses staging/backup/promote
- **Rollback Capable**: All operations can be undone on failure
- **Receipt Driven**: Idempotency through `.ai/guardrails/installed/*.json`
- **Sentinel Protected**: Never delete without marker files

### Deterministic Behavior
- **Stable Plans**: Same inputs produce identical `InstallPlan`
- **Hash Verification**: Source and target content validation
- **Conflict Detection**: Clear error reporting for incompatible components
- **Dependency Resolution**: Consistent ordering via `(priority, plugin.id)`
