## 🧪 **Testing Protocol**

### Phase 3A: Internal Validation (Current)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours
**Participants:** Development team members
**Method:** Walkthrough testing with fresh perspective

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Team member A: Test End User journey (clean machine/browser)
2. [ ] Team member B: Test Developer Setup journey (new clone)
3. [ ] Team member C: Test Template Contributor journey (new use case)
4. [ ] Document all friction points, confusion, and gaps
5. [ ] Rate documentation clarity (1-5 scale) for each persona

### Phase 3B: External Validation (Future)

**Duration:** 3-5 days
**Participants:** 2-3 external users per persona
