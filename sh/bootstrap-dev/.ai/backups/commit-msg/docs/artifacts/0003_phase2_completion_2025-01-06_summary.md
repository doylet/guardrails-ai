  - Configuration inheritance and merging support
  - Schema composition for complex validation rules
  - Profile-based configuration management

### ✅ Component Management
- **Component Manager** (`src/packages/core/component_manager.py`)
  - Component dependency resolution with topological sorting
  - Installation ordering based on dependencies and priorities
  - Atomic installation with rollback support
  - Component health monitoring and status tracking

### ✅ Enhanced Installation
- **Enhanced Plugin Installer** (`src/packages/adapters/enhanced_plugin_installer.py`)
  - Complete plugin installation workflow integration
  - Lifecycle hooks execution with security sandboxing
  - Template processing with variable substitution
  - Dry-run capability and progress reporting

### ✅ Integration & Testing
- **Updated Component Manager Integration**
  - Enhanced plugin installation support in existing system
  - Backward compatibility maintained with legacy adapter
